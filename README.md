This repository contains all the code that needs to be done to understand the flow of UI in C and the sorting algorithms

## INSTRUCTIONS
I'd recommend you to run the main.c file first as it is the main file that contains all the linkers.<br>
run this in your terminal to compile the code:<br>
    <br>gcc main.c sorting_algo.c -o main<br><br>
This compiles the code<br>
To run the code, enter the following command in your terminal:<br>
    <br>./main<br><br>
That should be it. You're ready to Go!
